## Palia Fishing OCR

This program is to help crowdsource fishing rate information in the game Palia.
How it works, is it reads your current active window (in this case it will need to be Palia) and analyzes the text to find a fish name to see if it exists in fish_list.txt.
Under the proper circumstances, it will display that the fish has been caught and at what time (Palia time) in the console.
This tool was created to be able to display the information at [www.paliafishingguide.com](www.paliafishingguide.com)
Please check it out if youre interested in a fishing guide that allows you to see where and when a fish is available, what bait it requires, and the percent chance of catching it!

## How to Use

1. Ensure that fish_list.txt and main.exe are in the same folder (can be placed anywhere).
2. Ensure that your game is running in borderless windowed mode (full screen does not work).
3. You must have the game as your active window for the OCR to pick up the text in it.
4. Simply close out of the window when you're done!
